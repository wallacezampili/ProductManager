# ProductManager
A product manager with JWT authentication allows users to add, edit, and remove products. Additionally, it offers dynamic category management for the products.

## Product Operations 
You can add, remove, delete and search for products by name and category once you are authenticated.

##Category System
It's possible to add a new category or use an existing one when editing or adding a new product. The system will keep track of categories without registered products and remove them, ensuring that the database and search feature remain clean.
